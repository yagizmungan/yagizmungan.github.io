            <p><em>Float Hybrid Entertainment</em> is a San Francisco based interactive agency with roots in movies and games. Founded by John Gaeta, Float's initial focus was natural gesture-based interfaces. Which later evolved to general mastery on combining design with emerging technologies.</p>

            <p>During my time in Float I have worked on variety of interfaces and displays from tiny screens of Google Glass to 65" 4K monitors, from WiP AR headsets to Oculus Developer Kit. I created interfaces that use Kinect to see you as well as interfaces that you use various headsets to see it. I worked on single page web apps, IoT, games, mobile applications and websites. My main technologies were Unity, HTML/CSS/JS and node.js</p>

           <p>The projects included prototypes for trade shows like CES, protypes for internal labs, products relased on appstores, installations for events like Football World Cup, SXSW and Anything Interactive, an in-house interactive framework.</p>
