            <p>"An abstract dystopia. The phases of the ever-evolving chain of being. An unstable world within worlds demonstrating the connectivity, the conflict, and the desire of a must that is imbued within every creature.</p>
            <p>This desire drives the individual to seek family, and the family to seek the stability of society. Lines are blurred between audience and performer, immersing all in possibility. Light, sound, and movement are created through interactive technologies.</p>
            <p>Enveloped in the void, the ringing sound of silence vibrates in space. A single sound is heard. Light pierces through black. We are born, we exist, we die – there is no escape. Metamorphosis is the only constant. It creates as it destroys. We struggle with the change upon which life rests.</p>
            <p>Ad Infinitum.</p>
            <p>Inspired by Karel and Josef Capeks’ The Insect Play, an interdisciplinary team collaborates to create a work that applies interactive gaming to performance. Ad Infinitum³ brings the audience into the performance as both characters and variable forces through the use of avatars created on any wi-fi equipped cell phone. Performers engage the audience in both the visual and auditory with audience controlled projections and sound."</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Above is the official description for Ad Infinitum<sup>3</sup> but I will define the project as follows:</p>
            <p>Ad Infinitum<sup>3</sup> is an installation that combines local multiplayer gaming (free-for-all Pacman before Agar.io), music, theater and dancing to create journey that is inspired by the Capek brother's The Insect Play.</p>
            <p>The audience used their cellphones to join the piece (as well as the cast and their avatars) and be the driving force in the narrative that explores the balance between individual and multiple-levels of society. The piece was composed of three acts, defined by three different games. The game engine was created with multiple techonolgies (Max/MSP/Jitter, Java, HTML/CSS/Javascript, IR tracking, interactive music, live musicians!, theatre lighting, etc...) to do what we want, connected via network.</p>
            <p/>It was a truly collaborative out of Purdue. I contributed to the game design, technology, visuals and audio. The shows were chaotic, confusing to some, energetic and fun. If you are curious watch the video below :)</p>
