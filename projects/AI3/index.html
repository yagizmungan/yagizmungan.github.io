            <p>Overfall is an indie game that combines rouge-like elements with tactical combat and RPG ideas.</p>
            <p>I helped Pera Games as an advisor on non-technical topics. Even though not a full time employee by any means, I was with the project from the early protoypes to Kickstarter to GDC booth.</p>
            <p>Some more details was I helped the team with general feedback on many levels, helped with the audio direction as well recruiting a certain RPG legend!</p>
