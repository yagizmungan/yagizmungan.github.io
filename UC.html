      <p class="style12">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">This project is a result of my personal observations in the USA as an international student:</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">Once the Thanksgiving Day is over; everywhere and everything that I can think of converts into the theme of Christmas. This theme is not only visual or behavioral but it is also audial. Starting the day after Thanksgiving, you start being subjected Christmas songs. Suddenly, from advertisements to elevators, everything starts singing Christmas songs. Every newly released album is a Christmas compilation or a cover of Christmas songs and carols that have been re-played, re-recorded, re-covered and re-compiled various times.        </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">I am well aware that I can not change the marketing tactics, yet at least as a person involved in music, I decided that I should take measures to stop this recycling of music. My aim is to create the ultimate Christmas album once and for all!</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">Ultimate Christmas Album: A Superposed-Collection of Most Popular Christmas Songs is my attempt to carry out this deed. The album is created by collecting one chart-topping Christmas song from a year and superposing the songs that belong to a decade to form a single song that represents the best Christmas songs of that decade. Finally, an album, consisting of these decade-songs, is created. </p>
      <span class="style9">The list of songs of  the album is:

      <span class="style9"><span class="style17">Process</span><br />
      </span>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">The work progress  can be explained by Ben Fry’s process of data representation. The process has  seven steps that starts with the collection of data and ends with the resulting  product.</p>
      <div align="justify">
        <ul>
          <li class="style9"><strong>Acquire</strong>:&nbsp;The  collection of data is mainly investigating various websites and Christmas  compilation albums for songs. The websites investigated are Amazon.com,  Wikipedia.com, Billboard.com, Youtube.com and many minor sites.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li class="style9"><strong>Parse</strong>:&nbsp;The  idea was having a single song that will represent the year. Thus songs are  ordered by year and by charts success. Even though, according to my rules, any  song that was either written or recorded or performed or became famous was  eligible for that year, I preferred the earliest date I was able to find that the song was  created.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="style9"><strong>Filter</strong>:&nbsp;The  main problem was the amount of songs that are recycled and that are covered. It  was possible to cover ten years with a single song. However, to get the most  variety recycled and covered songs were not using, unless they are obviously  the most famous version. Another aim was to have a good variety of songs thus  songs from same band and/or same style are avoided unless it was unavoidable.  In the end, I did not want to end up with five songs covering the whole time  since 1930’s.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="style9"><strong>Mine:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The  songs required some tweaks before they were mixed. The simple editing was made  on the loudness level. The average loudness level of the songs are calibrated  to -12dB in order to give all the songs a similar chance to shine.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="style9"><strong>Represent: </strong>&nbsp;The  songs are simply layered over each other with 10 songs from a decade forming  the song of the decade. The end product is an album, which covers 2000’s,  1990’s, 1980’s, 1970’s, 1960’s, 1950’s, 1940’s and partially 1930’s. Thus the  data, the best Christmas songs, is represented in the medium of the original  sources.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="style9"><strong>Refine:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Fine-tuning  of the sound levels was done after the initial calibration.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="style9"><strong>Interact:</strong>&nbsp;  The output is a music CD, which gives you all the interaction you can get from  a music CD.</li>
        </ul>
