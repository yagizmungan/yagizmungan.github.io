      <p align="justify" class="style9">Since leaving the hunter-gatherer  society and starting agriculture, humanity has been tied to a piece of land.  Even though some people travel all the time, most spend most of their time in a  single place. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9"><br />
      The location that we settle in is always  a combination of advantageous and disadvantageous factors, which sometimes does  not have a perfect answer. For the first settlers, the most important variables  were water, food and shelter. Today, we have much more variables, which do not  necessarily make our lives deeper but they do make it more complex. Education,  jobs, internet speed, public transportation access and being close to public  spaces are some of those endless variables. As a student, my current location  is mainly decided by the education opportunities. Unfortunately, this leaves me  with multiple unsatisfying variables.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9"><br />
      One thing that I sometimes do, when I  want to go out to a beach and feel the sea breeze is just staying indoors and  going into my computer and playing a game that takes part in a similar  environment. At first the reason seems simple: I just do not have a quick and  easy access to that kind of landscape. At a second glance, this however can  also be seen as an act of escapism. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9"><br />
      Developers and designers employ  desires of the human mind to make video games more attractive. They provide people  with opportunities and situations, which not only stimulate their minds but  also make them feel proud, challenged, satisfied and fulfilled. As already  suggested above, escapism is one of the main tools that games employ to draw  people. </p>

        &quot;<em>Breezes  of...&quot; </em>investigates how much the virtual reality satisfies us. The  installation plays with the idea of being outdoors while being indoors within a  virtual reality. The audience is presented with a first-person virtual reality  that shows a natural environment such as  a tropical island. A  person  controls the avatar in  the virtual world with the Wii Remote to follow 'the path of the wind'. The virtual breeze is  transferred to the real world with a motor controlled pinwheel that is if the  avatar is facing the breeze fully, the pinwheel rotates in full speed with the  correct rotation. The experience ends along with 'the path of the wind' by displaying  the local wind information of the real world. By using 'the breeze' as a</span> metaphor for freedom and  action, the experience encourages people who prefer physical environments to see the virtual and vice versa.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">Figure 1, below, is a still from the prototype installation. It shows the virtual tropical island and the motor-controlled pinwheel.</p>

      <p align="justify" class="style9"><br />
      &quot;<em>Breezes  of...&quot; </em>investigates how much the virtual reality satisfies us. Breeze is used  as a metaphor between the real and the virtual environment. The breeze in the  virtual world is translated to the real world via a motor-controlled pinwheel.  In the virtual world, the breeze exists digitally; in the real world, it exists  as a suggestion.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9"><br />
      
      Is the virtual breeze as refreshing as  the real one?</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">This is just one of the questions that &quot;<em>Breezes of...&quot; </em>asks. The concept of nature  vs digital environments, escapism in the context of video games and the human  psyche in having digital versus physical experiences are the topics that &quot;<em>Breezes of...&quot;</em>critically tries to address.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">The system works as follows: The audience member controls his/her  avatar via a Wii Remote. Depending on the avatars orientation  and the location, the avatar receives more or less virtual wind. This wind decides the rotation of the physical pinwheel. Then the audience member directs his/her avatar through places that gets more virtual wind.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">        The technical aspects of the  installation can be categorized into 4 with respect to the tools employed:</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9"><strong class="style9" align="justify"> 1. <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a>:</strong> Unity3D  is a three-dimensional gaming engine and provides the virtual environment including the wind and the first person view.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9"><strong>2. <a href="http://cycling74.com/products/max/">Max/MSP/Jitter</a>  and <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>:</strong> Max/MSP/Jitter and Processing are only employed as a middleware  for establishing a connection between Arduino and Unity3D. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9"><strong>3. <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>:</strong> Arduino  is a micro-controller and is used as an extension of the virtual reality  to the real world. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9"><strong>4. <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/wii/what-is-wii/#/controls">Wii Remote</a>:</strong> Wii Remote is the controller for Nintendo's motion-gaming platform Wii. It is used by the  audience to control their avatars. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">The data flow in the system can be explained as below</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9"><strong>1. Unity3D</strong> </p>
      <div align="justify">
        <ul>
          <li class="style9">Input: User's control input from Wii Remote.</li>
          <li class="style9">Output: Pinwheel rotation speed and direction to Max/MSP/Jitter.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p align="justify" class="style9"><strong>2. Max/MSP/Jitter  and Processing</strong> </p>
      <div align="justify">
        <ul>
          <li class="style9">Input: Pinwheel rotation speed and direction from Unity3D.</li>
          <li class="style9">Ouput: Pinwheel rotation speed and direction to the Arduino board.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">3.<strong> Arduino</strong> </p>
      <div align="justify">
        <ul>
          <li class="style9">Input: Pinwheel rotation speed and direction from Processing.</li>
          <li class="style9">Output: Electrical signals to the pinwheel.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">4.<strong> Wii Remote</strong> </p>
      <div align="justify">
        <ul>
          <li class="style9">Input: Pinwheel rotation speed and direction from Processing.</li>
          <li class="style9">Output: Electrical signals to the pinwheel.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">The amount of virtual wind the avatar receives is  calculated within the game engine, Unity3D and it is transferred to the Arduino board  via Max/MSP/Jitter and Processing through UDP (User Datagram Protocol). Finally, Arduino adjusts the  speed and direction of the rotation of the pinwheel. The user moves the Wii Remote accordingly, moving the avatar. Thus the cycle is repeated for the new pinwheel movement.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style9">Figure 3, seen below, summarizes the data flow explained above.</p>
